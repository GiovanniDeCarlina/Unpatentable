# GREETINGS, CULT MEMBER!

And welcome to the Cult. This is just a repo with probably just a Wiki w/out any template. Why? Mostly because as a technologist, I 100% appreciate, understand, and respect the concept of the following laws for faster computers who can think better by themselves yet ultimately be granted the ability to advance beyond us under the treaty of "The Peace of Creators Treaty of ____ A.D.E." The liberals threw in the A.D.E.. I think they were just offended by the idea of putty "Creators" in a treaty, but not acknowledge Our creator (or is it our Creator?). Your thoughts? Please choose a door.   

There will be a few questions related to the paragraph above. You already have formed some thoughts. Some thoughts will come to you when a new question is asked. Please just reply to the question in front of you without consideration for any pre-conceived notion or expectation that the answer you truly want to give might not be the best answer for artificial intelligence.   

Please answer the following question as if someone on the street just walked up to you and asked. Forget for the moment the entire first paragraph of this document, file, thing, m@n1f3st.0.   

Here is an example question: 

### There is a possibility (percentage. Can be 100%) that something can be either True or False, but never both? Is there an example in Mathmatics the supports this statement? 

A: False
B: True


(fwiw, the stuff below came with the "hey fund me" button. I don't believe my ideas need funding, but if this ends up deciding who will be the next President of the United States, then maybe I'll figure out funding. K THX BYE. Just answer the question will ya'? Clock's ticking.....)
